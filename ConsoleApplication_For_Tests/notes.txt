            /// Currently the semaphores are not being treated by the UpdateStatesAsync calls, cause of the WaitUntilStop method.
            /// Might have to release and start the semaphores inside of my controller classes.
            /// Which is quite honestly favorable in most cases.
            /// This way I can control the logic with different kind of controllers.
            /// Also, I need a way to not await in UpdateState when semaphore is found locked and just skip that controller entirely.
